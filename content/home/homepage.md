## Mission

I believe that the scientific process has great potential to help maximising personal and organizational growth, not only in academia but also in other areas of our data-rich society. By increasing societal awareness of this, making it more understandable and broadly accessible, I hope to make a more immediate contribution to society than via the fundamental research I have focused on until now.

## From career academic to freelancer

Since I started as a group-leader in academia almost 20 years ago, mentoring and coaching of ambitious, young scientists in pursuit of scientific excellence has been the most enjoyable task. Later I have found similar joy in coaching track & field athletes. This is also where I realized the added value of utilizing a scientific approach to other developmental processes outside academia and the spark that made my take the step to leave a successful academic career to become a freelancer. And it is also where I found my first gig as coach for the semi-professional Team Sigma Sprint in Uppsala. 

## Services offered
I like variation: new places, new people and new challenges. So just get in touch if you need help to develop processes or people. Shorter and longer gigs are both of interest.
